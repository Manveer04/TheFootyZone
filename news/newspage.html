Tottenham Hotspur had been among the clubs said to be interested in signing the out-of-favour centre-back, and West Ham have also joined the race in recent weeks due to David Moyes identifying the player as an ideal defensive reinforcement. That interest has now turned into a verbal bid, as sources have confirmed that the Hammers have lodged a £20m offer for the services of Maguire - an offer that was promptly rejected by Man Utd.'
